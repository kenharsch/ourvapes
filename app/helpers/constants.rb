	ABOUT_US = "VapeRater was created out of a desire to find trustworthy, useful 
information about vaping, vaping supplies and vaping health 
effects in a market where everything is new and constantly 
evolving. Our goal is to provide users with the ability to design 
their own kits through our ConfiguRator, research manufacturers 
and access the most up-to-date scientific data in one stop."

	ABOUT_VAPERATER_DEFINITIONS = "Here at VapeRater, our goal is to take the mystery out of vaping 
supplies for the new user while maintaining a sufficient density 
of information for the experienced user. We realize that our 
definitions simplify things perhaps too much at times, but by 
playing with our ConfiguRator we hope that users of any 
experience level will understand our reasoning and find some 
simple pleasure in creating a personalized vaping kit."

DESCRIPTIONS_SHORT = {}
DESCRIPTIONS_LONG = {}


DESCRIPTIONS_SHORT["mouthpiece"] = "The part that goes in your mouth, often integral to the tank. Also known as Drip Tip or Tip."

DESCRIPTIONS_LONG["mouthpiece"] = "The mouthpiece is most often a permanent part of the tank assembly, but in some cases the tip is removable and therefore replaceable. Different tips can provide a wider aperature for \"dripping\" juice directly on the coils. Almost invariably, a mouthpiece will come with a tank even if it is removable. People will choose different mouthpieces for comfort or style and most are interchangable."

DESCRIPTIONS_SHORT["tank"] = "Our definition of tank is anything that holds juice."

DESCRIPTIONS_LONG["tank"] = "Tanks come in many sizes and shapes. There are two very common, uniform types of adapter - the 510 and the eGo (sometimes E Go, EGO, etc. - don't worry, they all mean the same thing) which refer to standardized threading. We rank as generally compatible any two products with compatible adapters but this will be shown as a \"yellow\" match until our users upgrade it to \"green\" meaning that they work well together. Tanks that can screw together might be less than ideal due to non matching diameters - making them look mismatched, or because the fit is not tight - stressing the joint. Often, tanks have built-in mouthpieces and wicks. Common names: cartomizer (a disposable tank with liquid, filler and wick/heating element), clearomizer (see-through cartomizer), cartridge, rebuildable atomizer."

DESCRIPTIONS_SHORT["wick"] = "The wick is the disposable unit that transfers juice from the tank to a heating element which is then electrified to produce vapor."

DESCRIPTIONS_LONG["wick"] = "Wicks are generally specific to a tank and we recommend buying the wick that is designed for the tank you are using. That said, wicks come in varying degrees of resistance (measured in ohms). The lower the resistance, the hotter the coil gets and the more vapor produced per unit of time. In other words, lower resistance equals more vapor. However, the higher temperature comes at a cost. Many liquids will produce a slight to quite noticable burnt taste when run through low resistance coils. This is an area where trial and error works best to find what you like. Common names: atomizer, coil, dual(or triple, etc.) coil, heating element."

DESCRIPTIONS_SHORT["button"] = "The button, for our purposes, is the main assembly that holds electricity (via removable or built-in battery) and activates the coil via either push button or inhalation input from the user."

DESCRIPTIONS_LONG["button"] = "The button screws into the wick/tank assembly and provides the power. This is the most difficult to define as manufacturers all use different terms, usually only referring to their devices by trade names. Buttons come in many shapes from small rectangles to \"pipes\" to \"light sabers.\" There is a button for every taste. The primary differences in functionality can be assessed by voltage and wattage. Variable volt and variable watt devices are very popular owing to their ability to adjust to tank and wick differences as well as user taste. That said, many users end up set at 8 volts and there are many very capable single voltage devices. Common names: tube, vaping device, device, VV (variable voltage), Mod, Mechanical Mod, Personal Vaporizer (PV), m401, m402, m403, and many more."

DESCRIPTIONS_SHORT["battery"] = "Either built-in or removable, this holds electricity."

DESCRIPTIONS_LONG["battery"] = "Batteries should be checked against the recommendations of the button manufacturer. There are a few standard sizes and matching is generally not as daunting a task as the names of the products might suggest. Generally, your best bet is the manufacturers recommendation."

DESCRIPTIONS_SHORT["charger"] = "Plugs into the wall socket and charges batteries."

DESCRIPTIONS_LONG["charger"] = "The charger should be matched to the button and battery according to the manufacturers recommendations. Many buttons use a 510 connection to both charge and discharge their electricity, so this is a popular choice for beginners. Most of us eventually move into a \"passthrough\" device where the battery is integral and the charger plugs directly into the bottom of the battery or a device with removable batteries. The prime benefit of the removables is that you can swap batteries and never find yourself without power. Mixing and matching chargers should be done with extreme caution and preferably with more than a little knowledge of electrical engineering."

DESCRIPTIONS_SHORT["juice"] = "Juice Short TEMP."

DESCRIPTIONS_LONG["juice"] = "Juice Long TEMP."
